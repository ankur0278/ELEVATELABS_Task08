# About the Project
This is Task 8: Simple Sales Dashboard Design that I completed as part of my data visualization practice. I used Power BI to create an interactive sales dashboard that shows performance by product category, region, and month. This helped me learn the basics of Power BI — loading data, creating visuals, applying filters, and adding styling.

# Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Superstore_Sales.csv dataset

# Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes:
1. Line Chart – Sales trend over time (Month-Year)
2. Bar Chart – Sales by Region
3. Pie Chart – Sales by Category
4. Slicer – Region filter to view data dynamically

I also added color highlights to emphasize high and low performing areas, and formatted each visual with clear titles.
